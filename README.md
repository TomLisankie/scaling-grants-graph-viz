## How to use
- In the upper left corner you'll see a "Choose Files" button. Click this and select the Lever For Change grants CSVs that you would like to see (hint: ctrl + click when selecting files to select multiple files)
-- If you don't have these CSVs, ask SJ Klein or whoever you know who has access to the relevant data.
- Once you've selected the files, it will be anywhere between half a second and a few minutes before you see all of the nodes for the competitions on your screen.
- Selecting a different property from the "Group By" menu will group the submissions in different ways
- Green edges mean the submission was accepted, red edges mean it wasn't, gray edges mean that information wasn't available.
- You can click and drag the canvas to move it around, click and drag a node to move it around, and do a two-finger scroll gesture on a trackpad or use the scrollwheel on a mouse in order to zoom in.
- Clicking on a submission node (blue) will show more information about it in the upper-left area.
